TwitRunner
=========

This is a handy script to extract the number of twitter followers and
some additional information based on a .txt file.

I wrote it to mine data of teachers using twitter.

How to use it
-------------
You have to fill keys.txt with your Twitter developer (application)
tokens and users.txt with the ids and extra data you want to include.

Hopefully I'll clean it up to be more generic.

Todo
----
* Make users.txt self documented, somehow.
* Add sorting of results.
* Add a timestamp to results.

Contribute
----------
Although an extra simple, one-use tool, I'm happy to apply patches and
suggestions to make this more useful.
Feel free to fork me, or just mail me at diegoe@gnome.org.
